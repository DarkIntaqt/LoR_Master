## Development

LoR Master Tracker service is written by [Python3](https://www.python.org). The user interface is built by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue).

## Build Instructions

1. Install python3 and npm

2. Clone or Download the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/shaobaili3/LoR_Master
```

3. Run Python Service

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python LMTService.py
```

If this errors out, make sure that you have an `Python3` environment
variable pointing to the right path.

4. Run Electron User Interface

```shell
cd UI
npm install

// This will start a server. Served page can be accessed directly using browser as Web app version
npm run serve

// this will start Electron, accessing that served page but as Electron App version
npm run dev
```

Make sure you are in `UI` directory.

5. Bundle the Python service and Electron user interface into a single package:

The installer is automatically generated by CDCI on [Github Action](https://github.com/shaobaili3/LoR_Master/actions). Please refer to [python-app.yml](workflows/python-app.yml)
